# Project CSOM Read Local CustomFields

The github.com/OfficeDev/Project-CSOM-Read-Local-CustomFields sample uses C# and the Project CSOM to demonstrate how to access custom fields that are defined within a project. 

Users typically access local custom fields by opening a project using the Project Professional  or Project Pro for O365, then selecting Custom Fields from the Project tab of the ribbon.

2.	Update the PWA site
3.	Update the login/password to your PWA site.
4.  Upload the sample Project mpp file to PWA and publish
5.	Run the app
